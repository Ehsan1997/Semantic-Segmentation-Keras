# Semantic-Segmentation-Keras
I have implemented three different CNNs, namely SegNet, UNet, and DeepLabV3, for Semantic Segmentation of nuclei in digital histology images using Keras.

# Semantic Segmentation:
"Semantic segmentation, or image segmentation, is the task of clustering parts of an image together which belong to the same object class. It is a form of pixel-level prediction because each pixel in an image is classified according to a category.

Some example benchmarks for this task are Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Models are usually evaluated with the Mean Intersection-Over-Union (Mean IoU) and Pixel Accuracy metrics." -- [source](https://paperswithcode.com/task/semantic-segmentation)

# Problem Statement:
To implement an image segmentation pipeline using CNNs to get sementic understanding of the digital histology images.

# Dataset:
**Monuseg dataset** (available [here](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/)) contains multi organ tissue images with the ground truth segmentation masks for nucli. The dataset can also be downloaded from [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hnHjxFb52BdhxkcV_N7MdWLdagzXHzmq?usp=sharing) Google Drive link.
