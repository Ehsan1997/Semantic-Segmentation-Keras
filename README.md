Different CNNs for Semantic Segmentation using Keras

# Semantic Segmentation:
"Semantic segmentation, or image segmentation, is the task of clustering parts of an image together which belong to the same object class. It is a form of pixel-level prediction because each pixel in an image is classified according to a category.

Some example benchmarks for this task are Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Models are usually evaluated with the Mean Intersection-Over-Union (Mean IoU) and Pixel Accuracy metrics." -- https://paperswithcode.com/task/semantic-segmentation

# Problem Statement:
To implement an image degmentation pipeline using CNNs to get sementic understanding of the images.

# Dataset:
**Monuseg dataset** (available [here](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/)) is downloaded and the ground truth segmentation masks are created. The dataset can be either obtained from the instructor or can be downloaded from [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hnHjxFb52BdhxkcV_N7MdWLdagzXHzmq?usp=sharing) Google Drive link.
